# Releasing Localization

Follow the [Package release standard](package-release-standard.md) for the shared
quality gate, changelog parsing, publication and retry behavior. Normal publication
does not require administrator setup, active branch protection or a ruleset,
GitHub's immutable-release flag, or external attestations. Existing repository
rules and permissions still apply.

The required CI check is **Package gate**. Maintainers rebase reviewed PRs into the
repository's dynamically discovered default branch. The release workflow reruns
the complete source CI gate on that resulting commit, checks out the event's exact
`github.sha`, and verifies local `HEAD` matches it. A PR SHA is never the promised
future release identity. The newest stable SemVer changelog record selects the
version and must agree with the release manifests. An Unreleased-only changelog
does not publish; keep work that is not ready under `## Unreleased`.

## Artifact, platform and consumer verification

The archive includes LICENSE, the full charter/API/service/capability documentation,
examples, the release record and production sources. Tests, fixtures, vendor, tools and
workflow state are excluded. The clean-consumer gate installs this exact ZIP as a
dependency in a fresh Composer project with no-dev authoritative classmaps. It loads
every manifested type through the consumer autoloader and exercises standalone
translation and a real host-installed ServiceManager, including alias and lifetime
rules. Installing the archive as the consumer root would conceal dependency-relative
autoload defects and does not satisfy this gate.

The supported source-install lane is PHP 8.5 on Linux with the declared extensions.
PHP and ICU versions affect locale-sensitive data: record the actual PHP, ICU and
platform versions in independent evidence. Other platforms require their own proof
before support is claimed. The portable package does not embed a fixed ICU version.

Behavior changes need regression vectors, a reviewed changelog and SemVer
classification; pre-1.0 consumers pin exact versions. Rollback restores the previous
application/Composer lock and compatible PHP/ICU deployment together. Security
corrections follow the reporting policy and receive an unused successor version.
Portable tests remain package-owned; Core test retention follows the integration contract.

## Publication evidence and recovery

The maintainer performs the initial Packagist submission. Its GitHub integration
then follows tags without a registry credential in CI. Confirm `package-released`
from the successful default-branch publication run and matching published stable
release, tag and source identity. Publication does not establish `release-verified`.
Before declaring that state or SDK/App adoption, a fresh independent verifier must
bind the exact published source/tag, archive digest, manifests, registry coordinate,
license/security and clean-consumer results in an external RELEASE-ATTESTATION.yaml.
The artifact and release record must not invent their own final commit, checksum or
publication evidence. This attestation is separate from normal publication.

Use the current release workflow on the default branch to retry after correcting
the reported failure. Existing tags and releases must match their source identity
and are never moved, deleted or replaced. Later default-branch runs may verify a
published release on an ancestor; an unpublished tag can be completed only on the
exact event commit that passed the full gate. Only a confirmed HTTP 404 permits
creation; authentication, rate-limit and server failures never authorize creation.
A release with GitHub's immutable flag disabled remains platform-mutable; accepting
it for normal publication does not make it immutable. Fix defects with an unused
successor version. A green PR does not prove publication or independent verification.

## Optional administrator hardening

[Repository release setup](repository-release-setup.md) is an explicit optional
administrator action. `--check` only audits; `--apply` changes the managed settings;
adding `--dispatch` requests a release run after setup verification:

```bash
bash tools/configure-release-repositories.sh --check kumwe/localization
bash tools/configure-release-repositories.sh --apply kumwe/localization
bash tools/configure-release-repositories.sh --apply --dispatch kumwe/localization
```

The release workflow does not change repository settings automatically. This helper
requires repository Administration access, and dispatch also needs Actions write
permission. Keep administrator credentials out of Actions. A setup audit or dispatch
is neither a normal publication prerequisite nor proof that publication succeeded.
