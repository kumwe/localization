/**
 * Write face of the two administered override layers, kept apart from the read face the chain uses.
 *
 * `MessageOverrideRepository` answers the render path and is shaped for it: whole scope, one call, no
 * bookkeeping. This is the other half — what an administration surface needs to list, write and
 * withdraw an override. They are separate ports because they have opposite pressures: the read side
 * is on the hot path and must stay a single bounded fetch, while the write side is rare, per
 * identifier, and needs to say when and by whom.
 *
 * An implementation stores at most one pattern per layer, scope, locale and identifier, so writing
 * the same identifier twice replaces the wording rather than accumulating rows an operator would then
 * have to reconcile.
