 * Version 2 states nine: `en-GB`, `en-US`, `af`, `de`, `he`, `ar`, `es`, `pt-BR` and `zh-Hans`.
 * They are held in one place because three separate inputs — an explicit choice, an
 * `Accept-Language` header and the site's `default_locale` setting — all have to be reduced to a
 * locale that actually exists, and doing that reduction differently in three places is how a site
 * ends up rendering a language it does not carry. Order is preference order, so a request for a
 * language without a region resolves to the first variant declared for it: `en` becomes `en-GB`,
 * not `en-US`.
 *
 * The source locale is separate from the rest. Every message is authored in it, so it is the last
 * fallback before an identifier is returned as its own text.
