 * Port supplying the two administered layers of the chain: a site's wording and an organization's.

 * These are the layers an operator owns. They exist so that changing one word — relabelling
 * "Client" as "Patient" for a health vertical, as "Learner" for education, as "Guest" for
 * hospitality — is an administrative act rather than a fork of a catalogue, in one language or in
 * all of them. An implementation returns the whole bounded override map for a scope in one call
 * rather than answering per identifier, because the render path resolves hundreds of messages and
 * an override chain that becomes a lookup per message is a scale defect wearing a feature's name.
