/**
 * Decides which of the carried locales a unit of work renders in.
 *
 * Three inputs are consulted, in this order, and the first that names a carried locale wins: an
 * explicit choice the caller made, the languages the caller's client says it accepts, and the
 * site's `default_locale` setting. The order is what makes each input mean something — an explicit
 * choice is a decision and must not be overruled by a browser preference, a browser preference is
 * better than a guess, and the site setting is the operator's answer for everyone who expressed no
 * preference at all. When none of the three names a carried locale the source locale is used, so
 * negotiation always produces a locale and never a null a caller has to handle.
 *
 * Nothing here reads process state and nothing here writes any. The result is returned to the
 * caller, which is what keeps two units of work in one long-lived worker from sharing a language.
