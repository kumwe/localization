/**
 * Port every layer reads user-facing text through, given an identifier, a parameter bag and a locale.
 *
 * This is the whole translation contract as a caller sees it. The locale is an argument rather than
 * process state, and that is the load-bearing decision: this platform runs long-lived queue workers
 * and a scheduler, so a job for a site in Arabic and the next job for a site in German are handled
 * by the same process, and a selector held in the process would leak the first job's language into
 * the second. Passing the locale means two units of work in one worker cannot contaminate each
 * other, and it is the reason the operating-system locale is never consulted.
 *
 * An implementation resolves the identifier through the override chain, formats the result through
 * ICU MessageFormat, and never returns an empty string: a message the catalogues do not carry comes
 * back as its own identifier, because a visibly untranslated interface is recoverable and a silently
 * blank one is not.
