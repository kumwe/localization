 * Request-scoped holder for the locale and translation scope the unit of work in flight resolved.
 *
 * A Twig function receives only its arguments, and a console command receives only its input, so
 * the locale a middleware negotiated has to reach them through something the container shares. This
 * is that something, and it is deliberately the same shape as `CorrelationContext`: the middleware
 * opens a unit of work on it, everything rendered while it is open reads the same locale, and the
 * middleware closes it again in a `finally` so a long-lived worker never carries one request's
 * language into the next one's output.
 *
 * Nothing resolves a locale here. It holds what `LocaleNegotiator` decided and nothing else, and it
 * answers with the source locale outside a unit of work so a boot-time render is never locale-less.
