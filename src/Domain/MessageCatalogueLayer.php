 * One step of the override chain a message identifier is resolved through.

 * the base wording and everything above it corrects or completes it. The strategic one is
 * terminology adaptation — a health vertical relabelling "Client" as "Patient", an education
 * vertical as "Learner", a hospitality vertical as "Guest" — in one language or in all of them,
 * without forking core and without an extension shipping a parallel string table. That is why the
 * chain has four steps rather than two, and why resolution is per identifier rather than per file:
 * an operator changes one word without taking ownership of a catalogue.
